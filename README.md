TreeBASE
========

TreeBASE, the community repository of published estimates of phylogeny, is an initiative whose 
[history](https://treebase.org/treebase-web/about.html) dates back to the early 1990s. In its current iteration it is an open source 
project implemented in Java 1.5 and released under a BSD license. This is its source code repository. It is organized in a number of 
subprojects, which are described below. For more high-level documentation about TreeBASE, visit the 
[wiki](https://github.com/TreeBASE/treebase/wiki/Documentation).

### Essential subprojects for TreeBASE v.2

The following are subprojects that jointly comprise the TreeBASE v.2 MVC application. The application is organized as a data **Model** 
that persists on a PostgreSQL database via Hibernate, multiple **Views** (namely, a JSP/HTML GUI, an oai-pmh web service interface, a 
tree viewing and editing applet, and a news feed), linked together by a **Controller** API in Java 1.5, which uses the Spring framework.

- [treebase-core](treebase-core) - Java 1.5 ORM API to access the underlying relational database based on PostgreSQL
- [treebase-phylowidget](treebase-phylowidget) - Java 1.5 browser applet for tree viewing and editing
- [treebase-web](treebase-web) - Java 1.5 MVC web application for the JSP/HTML GUI
- [treebase_feed](treebase_feed) - PHP feed with newest studies, to embed in the JSP/HTML GUI
- [oai-pmh_data_provider](oai-pmh_data_provider) - additional Java 1.5 MVC functionality for OAI-PMH interface
